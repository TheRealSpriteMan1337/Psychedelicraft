*Have you ever wanted to get Steve or Alex high? Totally hammered? Stoned? Perhaps even stash some drugs in your walls? Well,* <i><ins>NOW YOU CAN!</ins></i>

Regardless â€” this mod lets you do so. With shaders, it accomplishes a party of colors on your screen like no other. It doesn't dissappoint.

Now on Minecraft 1.12.2, it can be paired with other mods.
